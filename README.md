## üõ†Ô∏è Configure Local Git Hooks

In order to enforce a consistent and healthy commit process, **please run the appropriate hook setup script**:

- For **macOS/Linux** users:  
  Run `setup-hooks.sh`
- For **Windows** users:  
  Run `setup-hooks.bat`

These scripts will install local Git hooks to validate your commit messages and prevent oversized files from being committed.
